# WeatherReport
This Project was build as a part of learning the GUI(using Tkinter) interface involving Python.

Weather Reporting App using Tkinter

This is a simple weather reporting app built using Python's Tkinter library and the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to enter a city name and retrieve the current weather information, including temperature and weather description. It serves as a basic example of how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Tkinter and how to integrate an external API for data retrieval.

Features:
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter widgets.
- Real-time weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays temperature in Celsius.
- Handles city not found cases and displays appropriate messages.

Note:
Make sure you have an active OpenWeatherMap API key to use this app. You can get your API key by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website.
